# Assignment 06 Rubric

Many ideas and wording are taken from the method of grading put forward in Harvard's CS50 course.

## The Formula

Score = (8 x Automated Correctness Checks) + (4 x Automated Style & Best Practice Analysis) + (8 x Attention to Detail)

## Automated Correctness Checks

_"Does your code do what it was asked to do?"_

- [ ] 5: All tests for all 8 methods pass.
- [ ] 4: All tests for 6 or 7 methods pass.
- [ ] 3: All tests for 4 or 5 methods pass.
- [ ] 2: All tests for 2 or 3 methods pass.
- [ ] 1: All tests for 1 method pass.
- [ ] 0: No tests pass.

## Automated Style & Best Practice Analysis

_"How closely does your code follow the automated rules you are given?"_

- [ ] 5: No errors detected.
- [ ] 2: One or two **types** of errors detected.
- [ ] 0: Three or more **types** of errors detected.

## Attention to Detail

_"How closely does your code approach the design ideals of clarity, efficiency, and maintainability? How much care have you put into your work?"_

- [ ] 5: Excellent. Essentially no room for improvement.
- [ ] 4: Very good. Minor room for improvement.
- [ ] 3: Good. Some room for improvement.
- [ ] 2: Fair. Ample room for improvement.
- [ ] 1: Poor.
- [ ] 0: No attempt.
