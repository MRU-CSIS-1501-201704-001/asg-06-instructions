# Assignment 06 Rubric

Many ideas and wording are taken from the method of grading put forward in Harvard's CS50 course.

## The Formula

Score = (8 x Automated Correctness Checks) + (4 x Automated Style & Best Practice Analysis) + (8 x Design)

## Automated Correctness Checks

_"Does your code do what it was asked to do?"_

- [ ] 5: Both challenges pass.
- [ ] 4: One challenge passes and another passes half the tests.
- [ ] 3: One challenge passes and the other passes less than half the tests.
- [ ] 2: One challenge passes at least half the tests and the other passes less than half the tests.
- [ ] 1: At least one test passes.
- [ ] 0: One or more compilation errors.

## Automated Style & Best Practice Analysis

_"How closely does your code follow the automated rules you are given?"_

- [ ] 5: No errors detected.
- [ ] 2: One or two **types** of errors detected.
- [ ] 0: Three or more **types** of errors detected.

## Design

_"How closely does your code approach the design ideals of clarity, efficiency, and maintainability? How much care have you put into your work?"_

- [ ] 5: Excellent. Essentially no room for improvement.
- [ ] 4: Very good. Minor room for improvement.
- [ ] 3: Good. Some room for improvement.
- [ ] 2: Fair. Ample room for improvement.
- [ ] 1: Poor.
- [ ] 0: No attempt.
